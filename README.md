# Multiple-Linear-Regression---Real-Estate-Housing-Price-Prediction

Conducted an extensive analysis of a real estate dataset, leveraging Multiple Linear Regression to create a predictive model for house prices. The project encompassed data visualization, preprocessing (including categorical variable handling, dummy variable creation, and scaling), and a systematic feature selection approach. By performing manual feature elimination, residual analysis, and predictions, a robust linear model was established. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to refine the model. This empowered the real estate company to identify crucial variables influencing property prices, enhancing their ability to strategically optimize property selling prices. The model's accuracy provided actionable insights, enabling the company to make data-driven decisions that ultimately boosted profitability.
